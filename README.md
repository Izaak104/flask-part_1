# flask-part_1

While the code runs without any errors, I have have challenges running it on the cloud services despite multiple attempts
espeically while using the terminals



create a vm
write flask code
log to the vm via ssh on gcp
while in console, run (sudo apt-get update)
install pip (sudo apt install python3-pip
clode the github repo to be uploaded
move into cloned directory
run nano to read python file (sudo nano app.py)
change "localhost" to 0.0.0.0
change port from original to ("80")
run (sudo python3 app.py) to launch to website
to close the website, type (Control C- (ctrlC))
